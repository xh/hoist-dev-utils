# Build-related files

* `index.html` - passed to `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to be the template index.html file for each client app. Note that this
  had been sourced from hoist-react, but as of hoist-dev-utils >= v8.1 is included with this project for simplicity.
* `requiredBlueprintIcons.js` - included by hoist-dev-utils >= v6.2 as a (very) streamlined replacement for the
  full set of Blueprint JS icons otherwise required by that library. See the comment at the top of the file for
  additional details and links.
