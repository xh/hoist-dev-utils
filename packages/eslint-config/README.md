# Hoist eslint-config

A shareable set of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configurations with ExHI's coding conventions and best practices
for Hoist React based development.

Due to limitations of how ESLint's `extends` directive works, this needs to be built and published as its own 
dedicated package. See https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs.
