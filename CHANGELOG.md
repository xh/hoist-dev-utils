[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.9.0...5.9.1)

## v5.9.0 - 2021-05-04

### ⚙️ Technical

* Updated default `targetBrowsers` config for Babel-based transpiling to replace `Edge >= 18` with
  `last 2 Edge versions` (v89-90 as of this release). This removes a certain amount of transpiled
  code generated to support Edge 18.
    * Edge 18 was the last version released before that browser's switch to the Chromium engine in
      January 2020.
    * ⚠ Any apps that require Edge 18 support and observe issues with this change can specify an
      appropriate set of targets within their `webpack.config.js` file.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.8.0...5.9.0)

## v5.8.0 - 2021-04-22

### 🎁 New Features

* New `faviconManifestConfig` option added to `configureWebpack()` build script. Allows
  customization of certain options related to adding a mobile app to a device home screen, as well
  as "installing" an app via Chrome's "create shortcut" option.
    * Default options also improved to properly set application name, version, and non-empty
      description (defaults to appName, but squelches console warning).
    * See https://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons#usage for supported options.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.7.0...5.8.0)

## v5.7.0 - 2021-04-09

### 🎁 New Features

* New `parseChangelog` option added to `configureWebpack()` build script. Set to `true` (default) to
  parse an application `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of your project directory for import by Hoist
  React's `XH.changelogService`, which will make its contents available to app users. (Changelog UI
  features require @xh/hoist v39.1+.)

### ⚙️ Technical

* The `configureWebpack()` build script function is now async, to support internal async calls. This
  is supported out-of-the-box by Webpack, and should not require any application-level changes.

### 📚 Libraries

* changelog-parser `added @ 2.8`
* css-loader `5.0 -> 5.2`
* mini-css-extract-plugin `1.3 -> 1.4`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.6.0...5.7.0)

## v5.6.0 - 2021-02-23

* Includes updated `@xh/eslint-config@3.0` with switch to `@babel/eslint-parser` - fixes
  auto-updates in toolchain dependencies that started to break linting.
* Additional type mapping in `module.rules` to support `.mjs` distros out of the `stylis` library,
  included as a transitive dep by `react-select@v4`.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel/* `7.12 -> 7.13`
* @xh/eslint-config `2.3 -> 3.0`
* autoprefixer `10.0 -> 10.2`
* case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin `2.3 -> 2.4`
* postcss `8.1 -> 8.2`
* sass `1.29 -> 1.32`
* webpack-bundle-analyzer `4.2 -> 4.4`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.5.0...v5.6.0)

## v5.5.0 - 2020-12-04

### 🎁 New Features

* New `sourceMaps` option added to `configureWebpack()` build script. Apps can now control sourceMap
  generation, including specifying `'devOnly'` to disable maps in production (a recommended security
  practice for untrusted environments). Default behavior is unchanged.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel/* `7.11 -> 7.12`
* @types/react `16.9 -> 17.0`
* autoprefixer `9.8 -> 10.0`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.4.0...v5.5.0)

## v5.4.0 - 2020-09-22

### 🎁 New Features

* When paired with `hoist-react >= v36.1.0`, this release of dev-utils will avoid the use of any
  inline script tags within the `index.html` file generated for each app. Instead, it will copy and
  inject a link to an unbundled copy of the `static/preflight.js` script supplied by hoist-react.
    * This allows for stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) headers - see Toolbox's nginx config @
      `docker/nginx/app.conf` for an example.

### 📚 Libraries

* copy-webpack-plugin `6.0 -> 6.1`
* css-loader `4.2 -> 4.3`
* file-loader `6.0 -> 6.1`
* html-webpack-plugin `4.3 -> 4.5`

* webpack-bundle-analyzer `3.8 -> 3.9`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.3.0...v5.4.0)

## v5.3.0 - 2020-08-20

### 📚 Libraries

Resolutions added for some transitive dependencies that had grown excessively stale and were
triggering console warnings on install/upgrade. Reviewed changelogs for these projects and did not
see any indication that they would be incompatible.

* @babel/core `7.10 -> 7.11`
* css-loader `3.6 -> 4.2`
* favicons-webpack-plugin `3.0 -> 4.2`
* mini-css-extract-plugin `0.9 -> 0.10`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.2.2...v5.3.0)

## v5.2.2 - 2020-07-21

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Fix check to detect if replacement stub file for Blueprint icons actually exists.
* (Note v5.2.1 release built but scratched due to error in fix above.)

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.2.0...v5.2.2)

## v5.2.0 - 2020-07-20

### 🎁 New Features

* App builds now load only a handful of `@blueprintjs` icons that are actually used by components.
  This change significantly reduces build size as BP ships a large set of generic SVG icons and
  bundles them all by default, but Hoist already includes FontAwesome as our standard icon library.
    * If the full set of Blueprint icons are required for a special app use-case, `configureWebpack()`
      now supports a new `loadAllBlueprintJsIcons` argument to revert to the previous behavior.
    * Requires `hoist-react` v35.2 or higher to supply the more minimal set of icon SVGs. Older
      versions of HR are compatible with this version of dev-utils, but the icons optimization will
      not be activated.

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `2.2 -> 2.3`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0)

## v5.1.0 - 2020-07-02

### 📚 Libraries

This version switches to the newly-recommended dart-sass library (aka the `sass` npm package) for
SASS compilation. This replaces the often-problematic usage of node-sass, which required OS-specific
tooling to support building native code on developer workstations.

* css-loader `3.5 -> 3.6`
* node-sass `removed`
* sass `added @ 1.26`
* sass-loader `8.0 -> 9.0`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0)

## v5.0.0 - 2020-06-12

### ⚖️ Licensing Change

As of this release, Hoist is [now licensed](LICENSE.md) under the popular and permissive
[Apache 2.0 open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Previously, Hoist was
"source available" via our public GitHub repository but still covered by a proprietary license.

We are making this change to align Hoist's licensing with our ongoing commitment to openness,
transparency and ease-of-use, and to clarify and emphasize the suitability of Hoist for use within a
wide variety of enterprise software projects. For any questions regarding this change, please
[contact us](https://xh.io/contact/).

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0)

## v4.6.0 - 2020-03-29

### 🎁 New Features

* New Babel preset-env `bugfixes` option defaulted to true. Intended to to further minimize
  transpilation to ES5 where not required by targeted browsers. See
  [Babel Docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#bugfixes).
* New `babelPresetEnvOptions` config accepted to allow direct override / customization of options
  passed to the babel-loader preset-env preset (including disabling the new option above if
  problematic).
* New `dupePackageCheckExcludes` config accepted to suppress duplicate package warnings by name.
  Defaulted to exclude longstanding (but not problematic) warning for `tslib`.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.4.1...v4.5.0)

## 4.4.1 - 2020-02-26

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Fixed favicon generation with upgrade of plugin - generated HTML again includes tags for correctly
  sized favicons across a variety of platforms.

### 📚 Libraries

* favicons-webpack-plugin: `1.0 -> 2.1`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.6...v4.3.7)

## 4.3.6 - 2019-11-19

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Disable Terser mangling of identifiers / variables due to intermittent and difficult to debug
  issues with it breaking code, especially when run on already-packaged libraries. Disabling does
  increase bundle size, although not by much on a relative basis.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.5...v4.3.6)

## 4.3.5 - 2019-11-15

### 📚 Libraries

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.4...v4.3.5)

## 4.3.4 - 2019-10-14

### ⚙️ Technical

* Bundled `@types/lodash` and `@types/react` as dev dependencies for developer convenience / better
  hinting options from IDEs, including support for types such as `ReactNode` in jsdoc comments.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel/preset-react `7.0 -> 7.6`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.3...v4.3.4)

## 4.3.3 - 2019-10-07

### ⚙️ Technical

* Add new `terserOptions` config as hook for app builds to customize Terser minification directly if
  required, although defaults should continue to be fine as they are. Added `keep_classnames: true`
  to the Terser defaults now that we are emitting classes.

### 📚 Libraries

* url-loader `2.1 -> 2.2`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.3)

(4.3.2 was an accidental no-op build 😞)

## 4.3.1 - 2019-10-02

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `2.1 -> 2.2`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1)

## 4.3.0 - 2019-09-27

### ⚙️ Technical

* Removes a previous workaround in `configureWebpack` to always transpile JS code down to ES5
  (implemented by pushing IE11 onto the `targetBrowsers` config passed to `babel/preset-env`). Babel
  will now actually use Hoist's default target browsers (recent versions of Chrome, Safari/iOS, and
  Edge) resulting in a build output with significantly less transformation of the source code.
* Apps or client environments that find they need support for less capable browsers (e.g, a secure
  mobile browser using an older JS engine) can pass a custom `targetBrowsers` array to adjust the
  output.

### 📚 Libraries

* webpack `4.40 -> 4.41`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.2.0...v4.3.0)

## 4.2.0 - 2019-09-23

### 🎁 New Features

* Support for the nullish coalescing operator `let foo = bar ?? 'default'` via the
  `@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator` plugin.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.1.2...v4.2.0)

## 4.1.2 - 2019-09-18

* Tweak to skip logging (spurious) packaged Hoist version when running with Hoist inline.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)

## 4.1.1 - 2019-09-17

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `2.0 -> 2.1.1`
* terser-webpack-plugin `2.0 -> 2.1`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.1)

## 4.0.0 - 2019-09-12

This release includes a number of major/minor updates for the build toolchain. Most notably, it
updates Babel and its plugins from `7.4 -> 7.6`, which removes support for the `@babel/polyfill`
plugin we had been using in favor of `core-js@3` for polyfills (as of 7.5).

### 🎁 New Features

* Support for the nullsafe operator `let foo = bar?.baz` via the
  `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining` plugin.
* Support for `Promise.allSettled()` via the `core-js` polyfills. Hoist v28 will remove its
  dependency on the RSVP library which previously provided this utility.

### 💥 Breaking Changes

* **Requires Hoist React v28+**, which adds a required runtime dependency on `core-js` for polyfills
  as well as a new static import file referenced by `configureWebpack()` to provide a
  once-per-entry-point import of `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime`.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel `7.4 -> 7.6`
* @xh/eslint-config `1.2 -> 2.0`
* webpack `4.31 -> 4.40`
* *Multiple* other library updates for loaders, plugins, and other utils.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.8.1...v4.0.0)

## v3.8.1 - 2019-08-19

### ⚙️ Technical

* Ensure react is resolved to a single instance of the library when running in `inlineHoist` mode.
  (Avoids errors when attempting to call hooks that will throw if called across multiple instances
  of the library.)

## v3.7.5 - 2019-07-23

### ⚙️ Technical

* Added Webpack `DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin` to warn on build if non-overlapping dependency
  requirements force the inclusion of a package multiple times. (This was happening with lodash,
  unexpectedly.)

### 📚 Libraries

* Updated lodash to latest patch release (security fixes)
