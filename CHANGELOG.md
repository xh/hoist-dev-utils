## 4.3.6 - 2019-11-19

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Disable Terser mangling of identifiers / variables due to intermittent and difficult to debug
  issues with it breaking code, especially when run on already-packaged libraries. Disabling does
  increase bundle size, although not by much on a relative basis.

## 4.3.4 - 2019-10-14

### ⚙️ Technical

* Bundled `@types/lodash` and `@types/react` as dev dependencies for developer convenience / better
  hinting options from IDEs, including support for types such as `ReactNode` in jsdoc comments.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel/preset-react `7.0 -> 7.6`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.3...v4.3.4)

## 4.3.3 - 2019-10-07

### ⚙️ Technical

* Add new `terserOptions` config as hook for app builds to customize Terser minification directly if
  required, although defaults should continue to be fine as they are. Added `keep_classnames: true`
  to the Terser defaults now that we are emitting classes.

### 📚 Libraries

* url-loader `2.1 -> 2.2`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.3)

(4.3.2 was an accidental no-op build 😞)

## 4.3.1 - 2019-10-02

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `2.1 -> 2.2`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1)

## 4.3.0 - 2019-09-27

### ⚙️ Technical

* Removes a previous workaround in `configureWebpack` to always transpile JS code down to ES5
  (implemented by pushing IE11 onto the `targetBrowsers` config passed to `babel/preset-env`). Babel
  will now actually use Hoist's default target browsers (recent versions of Chrome, Safari/iOS, and
  Edge) resulting in a build output with significantly less transformation of the source code.
* Apps or client environments that find they need support for less capable browsers (e.g, a secure
  mobile browser using an older JS engine) can pass a custom `targetBrowsers` array to adjust the
  output.

### 📚 Libraries

* webpack `4.40 -> 4.41`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.2.0...v4.3.0)

## 4.2.0 - 2019-09-23

### 🎁 New Features

* Support for the nullish coalescing operator `let foo = bar ?? 'default'` via the
  `@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator` plugin.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.1.2...v4.2.0)

## 4.1.2 - 2019-09-18

* Tweak to skip logging (spurious) packaged Hoist version when running with Hoist inline.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)

## 4.1.1 - 2019-09-17

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `2.0 -> 2.1.1`
* terser-webpack-plugin `2.0 -> 2.1`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.1)

## 4.0.0 - 2019-09-12

This release includes a number of major/minor updates for the build toolchain. Most notably, it
updates Babel and its plugins from `7.4 -> 7.6`, which removes support for the `@babel/polyfill`
plugin we had been using in favor of `core-js@3` for polyfills (as of 7.5).

### 🎁 New Features

* Support for the nullsafe operator `let foo = bar?.baz` via the
  `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining` plugin.
* Support for `Promise.allSettled()` via the `core-js` polyfills. Hoist v28 will remove its
  dependency on the RSVP library which previously provided this utility.

### 💥 Breaking Changes

* **Requires Hoist React v28+**, which adds a required runtime dependency on `core-js` for polyfills
  as well as a new static import file referenced by `configureWebpack()` to provide a
  once-per-entry-point import of `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime`.

### 📚 Libraries

* @babel `7.4 -> 7.6`
* @xh/eslint-config `1.2 -> 2.0`
* webpack `4.31 -> 4.40`
* *Multiple* other library updates for loaders, plugins, and other utils.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.8.1...v4.0.0)

## v3.8.1 - 2019-08-19

### ⚙️ Technical

* Ensure react is resolved to a single instance of the library when running in `inlineHoist` mode.
  (Avoids errors when attempting to call hooks that will throw if called across multiple instances
  of the library.)

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.8.0...v3.8.1)

## v3.8.0 - 2019-08-16

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `1.1.1 -> 1.2.0` - react-hooks plugin and linting rules.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.7.7...v3.8.0)

## v3.7.7 - 2019-08-07

### ⚙️ Technical

* Added new `checkForDupePackages` flag, default true to mirror previous behavior added in 3.7.5.
  Set to false to disable duplicate package checking / warnings if unwanted.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.7.6...v3.7.7)

## v3.7.6 - 2019-07-25

### 📚 Libraries

* @xh/eslint-config `1.1.0 -> 1.1.1` - whitelist WebSocket global.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-dev-utils/compare/v3.7.5...v3.7.6)

## v3.7.5 - 2019-07-23

### ⚙️ Technical

* Added Webpack `DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin` to warn on build if non-overlapping dependency
  requirements force the inclusion of a package multiple times. (This was happening with lodash,
  unexpectedly.)

### 📚 Libraries

* Updated lodash to latest patch release (security fixes)
